# Minesweeper

This is one of the first Android projects I did while in Budapest. It is a simple minesweeper game following the traditional rules!

## Getting Started

If you're interested, all you have to do is fork the repo and enjoy!

### Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, and an emulator or an Android device.

### Installing

The only thing to note after downloading this is that some parts might be outdated, and the program was built with a specific package. You should probably change the manifest file.
